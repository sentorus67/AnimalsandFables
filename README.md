- When the user click the links of the stories linked to an animal, it will navigate to the Gutenberg.org free resourced book.  

- When the user clicks Animal Catalogue in the nav bar, it will direct to another page that displays animals. Then when the user clicks of the animal image, it will pop up the information about the animal (same information that main page provides).
