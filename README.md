## Description

## Functionality:

## Usage:

- When the user click the links of the stories of today's animal, it will navigate to the Gutenberg.org about the book.  

- When the user clicks Animal Catalogue in the nav bar, it will direct to another page that displays animals. Then when the user clicks of the animal image, it will pop up the information about the animal (same information that main page provides). 

- When the user clicks Bookmark in the nav bar, it will bookmark the today's animal and create a butotn within the navbar that the user can click to retrieve that days information.
